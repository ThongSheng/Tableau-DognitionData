# Tableau-DognitionData
Dognition (www.Dognition.com) enables dog owners to better understand their dog by providing a set of science-based games that measures and reports on the dog's unique cognitive style.
This project aims to create charts and visualizations on the Dognition data using Tableau. <br>
These charts will be used in data analysis and a data-driven business process change proposal to Dognition company management about how to increase the numbers of tests users complete. <br>
These charts include:
1. Completed games against time (line)
2. Free start users on number of games completed (side by side bar plot)
3. Creating ranks for "Created At" variable that determines at what time do owners complete each game (creating Tableau calculations)
4. When do users drop out of games (bar)

**Program used:** Tableau
